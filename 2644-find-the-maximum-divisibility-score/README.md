<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-divisibility-score/">2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>You are given two <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer arrays <code>nums</code> and <code>divisors</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>divisibility score</strong> of <code>divisors[i]</code> is the number of indices <code>j</code> such that <code>nums[j]</code> is divisible by <code>divisors[i]</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the integer</em> <code>divisors[i]</code> <em>with the maximum divisibility score</em>. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,7,9,3,9], divisors = [5,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 5.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 1 since nums[0] is divisible by 2.
The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 3 since nums[2], nums[3], and nums[4] are divisible by 3.
Since divisors[2] has the maximum divisibility score, we return it.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [20,14,21,10], divisors = [5,7,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 2 since nums[1] and nums[2] are divisible by 7.
The divisibility score of divisors[2] is 2 since nums[0] and nums[3] are divisible by 5.
Since divisors[0], divisors[1], and divisors[2] all have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[2]).
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [12], divisors = [10,16]
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The divisibility score for every element in divisors is:
The divisibility score of divisors[0] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 10.
The divisibility score of divisors[1] is 0 since no number in nums is divisible by 16.
Since divisors[0] and divisors[1] both have the maximum divisibility score, we return the minimum of them (i.e., divisors[0]).
